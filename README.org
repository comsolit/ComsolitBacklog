* Mantis Scrum backlog

** Overview

This plugin allows to prioritize Issues of a project relative to each other
and thus to manage a Scrum/Agile backlog of user stories.

The plugin adds the menu item "backlog". The view of the backlog is separated
in prioritized (at the top) and unprioritized Issues (at the bottom). The top
area is the "backlog". Items in the bottom area have not yet been added to the
backlog. Issues can be moved from the bottom area to the backlog either by the
action buttons in each line or by drag-and-drop.

Inside the backlog the items can be moved around by drag-and-drop.

** Installation

Place the content of this plugin inside your mantis installation under
plugins/ComsolitBacklog. You also need to configure three global variables in
your config_inc.php:

- $g_comsolitBacklog_prioritizedStatus - (int) status to give to prioritized
  issues
- $g_comsolitBacklog_unprioritizedStatus - (int) status of items that may
  appear in the unprioritized area
- $g_comsolitBacklog_categories - (array of string) names of categories that
  may appear in either area

** Implementation

The plugin adds an additional decimal (float) column 'backlog_position' to the
mantis_bug_table. This value indicates the position of the Issue in the
backlog with lower values indicating higher priority or position.

When an item is moved in the backlog, the new backlog_position value is
calculated to be in the middle of the item before and after it, i.e.:

backlog_position=.5*(issue_before.backlog_position + issue_after.backlog_position)

If the item is moved to the top of the list than issue_before.backlog_position
is assumed ot be zero.

If the item is moved to the bottom of the list than

backlog_position=issue_before.backlog_position + pow(2,16)

After enough movement operations it can happen that the limit of the databases
floating point precision is reached. Therefor a 'rebalance' operation is
performed when the minimum distance between two items falls below one. During
rebalancing all Issues in the backlog get new backlog_position numbers which
are multiples of pow(2,16).

** Development Status

The code has only been tested against MySQL.

** Third party libraries

The plugin uses [[http://angularjs.org][AngularJS]] as the only JavaScript library and [[http://jasmine.github.io][Jasmine 2]] for
testing.
